  <h3 align="center">Case Study 01: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?</h3>
</div>

***Scenario:***

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Our goal is to answer three questions:

    1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
    2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
    3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
