You are a junior data analyst working for a business intelligence consultant. You have been at your job for six months, and your boss feels you are ready for more responsibility. He has asked you to lead a project for a brand new client â€” this will involve everything from defining the business task all the way through presenting your data-driven recommendations. You will choose the topic, ask the right questions, identify a fresh dataset and ensure its integrity, conduct analysis, create compelling data visualizations, and prepare a presentation.

For this one we have Five questions will guide your case study:

    1. What type of company does your client represent, and what are they asking you to accomplish?
    2. What are the key factors involved in the business task you are investigating?
    3. What type of data will be appropriate for your analysis?
    4. Where will you obtain that data?
    5. Who is your audience, and what materials will help you present to them efectively?
