<h2>Context</h2>

This repository contains the capstone projects developed during the final course of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/#?modal_active=none). Which is a specialization, with seven courses in total and a final project (the capstone), available through the [Coursera platform](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=gwgsite&_ga=2.9421750.2040741674.1653285212-1302159354.1638532535).

The objective of this capstone project is to apply the knowledge developed during the course:

    * Going through the Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, and Share phases of the data analysis process;
    * Stating a business task clearly;
    * Importing data from a real dataset;
    * Documenting any data cleaning that you perform on the dataset;
    * Analyzing the data;
    * Creating data visualizations from your analysis;
    * Summarizing key findings from your analysis;
    * Documenting your conclusions and recommendations;
    * Creating and publishing your case study.

For this, we're offered two tracks:

| Track 01 | Track 02 |
| :-- | :-- |
| Working with existing questions and datasets. | Choosing your own questions and dataset |
| In this path the goal is to demonstrate job skills for future interviews using a given dataset for analysis. | For this, we aim to create a more flexible portfolio piece about a personal interest that you have. |

It is not necessary to undertake any of the projects as there is no peer review to complete the course. However, it is highly recommended.

So, out of personal interest, and because I believe it will be of great value to my professional development, I will carry out the two projects offered in track 01, and also a personal project for track 02.
