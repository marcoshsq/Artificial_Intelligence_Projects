<h2>About:</h2>

This repository contains the capstone projects developed during the final course of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/#?modal_active=none). Which is a specialization, with seven courses in total and a final project (the capstone), available through the [Coursera platform](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=gwgsite&_ga=2.9421750.2040741674.1653285212-1302159354.1638532535).

The objective of this capstone project is to apply the knowledge developed during the course:

    * Going through the Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, and Share phases of the data analysis process;
    * Stating a business task clearly;
    * Importing data from a real dataset;
    * Documenting any data cleaning that you perform on the dataset;
    * Analyzing the data;
    * Creating data visualizations from your analysis;
    * Summarizing key findings from your analysis;
    * Documenting your conclusions and recommendations;
    * Creating and publishing your case study.

For this, we're offered two tracks:

| Track 01 | Track 02 |
| :-- | :-- |
| Working with existing questions and datasets. | Choosing your own questions and dataset |
| In this path the goal is to demonstrate job skills for future interviews using a given dataset for analysis. | For this, we aim to create a more flexible portfolio piece about a personal interest that you have. |

It is not necessary to undertake any of the projects as there is no peer review to complete the course. However, it is highly recommended.

So, out of personal interest, and because I believe it will be of great value to my professional development, I will carry out the two projects offered in track 01, and also a personal project for track 02.

<h2>Track 01 details:</h2>

***"The first track involves a case study similar to what you might be asked for in a job interview. You will be given a business task, dataset, and list of specific deliverables that you must present to stakeholders. The first track will help you to create a case study that you could include in your portfolio to demonstrate job skills for future interviews. You can choose from between two cases. Once you decide which case study packet to use, you will read the details, complete the analysis, and create your finished case study.*** 

***If this track interests you, explore the case study options and decide which one you want to perform. The case study packets available for download have everything that you need to complete your case study. Then, you will be ready to upload and share your case study with potential employers."***

<h3>Case Study 01: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?</h3>

***Scenario:***

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Our goal is to answer three questions:

    1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
    2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
    3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Work in progress...

<h3>Case Study 02: How can a wellness company play it smart?</h3>

***Scenario***

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. 

Our goal is to answer three questions:

    1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
    2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
    3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
