<h2>About:</h2>

This repository contains the capstone projects developed during the final course of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/#?modal_active=none). Which is a specialization, with seven courses in total and a final project (the capstone), available through the [Coursera platform](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=gwgsite&_ga=2.9421750.2040741674.1653285212-1302159354.1638532535).

The objective of this capstone project is to apply the knowledge developed during the course:

    * Going through the Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, and Share phases of the data analysis process;
    * Stating a business task clearly;
    * Importing data from a real dataset;
    * Documenting any data cleaning that you perform on the dataset;
    * Analyzing the data;
    * Creating data visualizations from your analysis;
    * Summarizing key findings from your analysis;
    * Documenting your conclusions and recommendations;
    * Creating and publishing your case study.

For this, we're offered two tracks:

* Track 01: Working with existing questions and datasets.

* Track 02: Choosing your own questions and dataset.

It is not necessary to undertake any of the projects as there is no peer review to complete the course. However, it is highly recommended.

<h2>Track 01 details:</h2>

"The first track involves a case study similar to what you might be asked for in a job interview. You will be given a business task, dataset, and list of specific deliverables that you must present to stakeholders. The first track will help you to create a case study that you could include in your portfolio to demonstrate job skills for future interviews. You can choose from between two cases. Once you decide which case study packet to use, you will read the details, complete the analysis, and create your finished case study." 

"If this track interests you, explore the case study options and decide which one you want to perform. The case study packets available for download have everything that you need to complete your case study. Then, you will be ready to upload and share your case study with potential employers."

***Scenario 01:***

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Our goal is to answer three questions:

    1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
    2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
    3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

And create a report with a concise analysis and strong visualizations to deliver to executives.

<h2>Final considerations:</h2>

I had carried out this project for a long time, but I wasn't very confident with the results. Impostor syndrome didn't allow me to publish it...

But anyway, after a period of more in-depth study, I finally managed to deliver something a little more presentable, and well... better late than never.

I think this project is fundamental for the real learning of the content taught in the course, I believe it is more important than all seven courses together.

But in the end, that's what it's about. I thank Coursera and Google for allowing me to study such rich and high-quality content, and they are two entities that are having a very positive impact on my professional development!
