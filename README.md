## About:

I like to keep things organized, so I created this repository to serve as a hub for all my AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision) related projects. This is a way for me to find these projects in an easier way in a centralized location.

Here are the links to the original repositories where the codes of these projects are stored.

- [Python plays Flappy Bird]() - In this project, I built a clone of the flappy bird game with Python, using the Pygame, OS and random libraries. Then, used a NEAT algorithm, to teach the "computer" to beat the game.
